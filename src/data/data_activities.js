      description: `An assortment of projects showcasing Machine Learning in context of robotics.
      Done for an online course at Udacity, which tested my knowledge on concepts such as 
      <strong>Neural networks, Semantic segmentation, SLAM, and RL</strong>
      â€” used <strong>TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch</strong> in <strong>Jupyter</strong> to build and train models. 
      Simulated robots and their environment using <strong>ROS and Gazebo</strong>. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Notable projects: 
      <ul>
        <li>Trained a model to recognize six different hand signs.</li>
        <li>Created a target-chasing robot using a model trained to perform 
        semantic segmentation to find a target figure. Pixel location of the target figured is extracted from a camera feed
        in order to control motors.</li> 
        <li>Simulated a home-service robot by using RTAB-mapping to map a simulated room, and then 
        used AMCL to guide a robot to a target location.</li>
      </ul>
