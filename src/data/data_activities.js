      on Robotics Software, and Deep Neural Networks. Acquired and utilized knowledge on machine learning 
      concepts (CNN, Rtab-mapping, and RL), and libraries and tools (ROS, Rviz, Gazebo). 
      A notable project is hand-sign recognition model that I trained to 
      recognize 6 different hand signs. Used PyTorch and Jupyter to build. 
      My cohorts were the first to take this coures.`
